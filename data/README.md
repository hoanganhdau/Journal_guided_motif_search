These are datasets used in the paper "Matrix Profile V: A Generic Technique to Incorporate Domain Knowledge into Motif Discovery."

The subsequence lengths that we used are specified in the name of the dataset.
Subsequence length is subject to problem domain and user preference.

- **ECG_LTAF_71_subLen_150.mat**: ECG data from the LTAF-71 database.
Recommended subsequence length: 150

- **fNIRS_subLen_600.mat**: Brain imaging data. First row is fNIRS data. Second row is acceleration data.
Recommended subsequence length: 600

- **finger_flexion_subLen_3500.mat**: little finger flexion dataset
Recommended subsequence length: 3500

- **EOGL_short_subLen_450.mat**: left-eye EOG sampled at 50Hz
Recommended subsequence length: 450

- **epilepsy_walking_subLen_16.mat**: Five recordings of mimicking epilepsy seizure and three recordings of walking task concatenated.
Recommended subsequence length: 16

- **epilepsy_train_subLen_16.mat**: one recording of mimicking epilepsy seizure
Recommended subsequence length: 16

- **earthquake_short_subLen_2000.mat**: Two occurrences of earthquake and two snippets of motion artifact concatenated.
Recommended subsequence length: 2000

- **mallat_dataset_subLen_512.mat**: consists of 1000 time series, each of length 20,000. Each time series is created by making a random walk of length 20,000, then embed into it two randomly chosen instances from the eigh-class MALLAT dataset from the UCR Archive.
Recommended subsequence length: 512

**mallat_motif_location.mat**: contains the start location of the two motif embedded.
